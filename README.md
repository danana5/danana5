>Don't half ass two things... Whole ass one thing - Ron Swanson

I'm currently studying Computer Science in Trinity College Dublin. I enjoy full-stack programming but rather front-end. I used to play semi-proffesional football and ehh I was decent at it I guess...

I love music, football and movies... Love a good software so I do and I like chilling with my mates. Thats if we are ever able to chill with are mates again of course... anyways please enjoy my lackluster github profile
